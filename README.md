# vision
A playground with no optimizations, and "almost" no dependencies
It is not intended to be fast. it is intended to be clear.

## Features
- Planar image represention using floating point operations
- Basic Mat structure with simple usage
- Convolutions
- Nearest Neighbor and Bilinear interpolations and resize
- Filters (Gaussian, sobel, etc)
- Harris Corner detector
- Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection
- Homography calculation
- RANSAC fitting example for noisy matched features
- Lukas Kanade optical flow calculation

if you think you saw this code before, probably you saw it on Joseph Redmon vision homeworks, or [darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet).
